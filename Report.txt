Task Title: ATM Interface Program Development

Task Description: Develop an ATM interface program in Java that allows users to perform banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.

Steps Taken:

Created a new Java project in Spring.
Defined ATM functionalities including checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.
Created a User class with attributes such as userID, userPIN, and accountBalance.
Developed an ATM class encapsulating ATM functionalities with methods for each operation.
Implemented user authentication by prompting users to enter their user ID and PIN.
Utilized Java's input/output functionalities to interact with users, displaying appropriate messages and prompts.
Implemented error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid user input and insufficient funds.
Thoroughly tested the program with different scenarios to ensure functionality and reliability.
Documented the code using comments to explain the purpose of each class, method, and significant block of code.
Included a README file with instructions on running the program and other relevant information.
Challenges Faced:

Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to cover various edge cases.
Ensuring secure user authentication without compromising user data.
Managing user interface elements for seamless user interaction.
Solutions Implemented:

Utilized try-catch blocks for handling exceptions and provided informative error messages.
Employed encryption techniques for storing and validating user credentials securely.
Used intuitive user prompts and messages to guide users through the interface.
Learnings:

Enhanced my understanding of object-oriented programming principles in Java.
Learned about best practices for handling user authentication and input validation.
Gained experience in designing and implementing a software system with multiple interacting components.
Project Update:
The ATM Interface program has been successfully developed and tested. It provides users with a secure and user-friendly interface to perform banking operations. All functionalities, including user authentication, balance checking, withdrawal, and deposit, are working as expected. The codebase is well-documented, and a README file has been included with instructions for running the program. Further improvements and enhancements may be considered based on user feedback and future requirements.
